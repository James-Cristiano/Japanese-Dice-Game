# Japanese-Dice-Game
A text game based on a traditional Japanese dice game

## Description
In this game you have the option to place bets and call whether the total on the dice is Even or Odd. The idea of this program was to get an idea of how while loops work as well as keeping track of a variable while the loop repeats.
This is purely text based so no fancy GUI here this time around. 

## Roadmap
Eventually I would like to have it so there is computer players that you can play against. It might start as just having them guess the number as well, but would like it so they can also palce bets too
